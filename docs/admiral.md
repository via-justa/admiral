## admiral

Admiral is a lightweight Ansible inventory database management tool

### Synopsis

Admiral is a command line tool to manage ansible inventory. It can also 
expose the inventory to ansible as a full inventory structure. As monitoring is 
also important, the tool can also expose the inventory in Prometheus static file 
structure where all the host groups are set as host 'groups' label.

The tool is expecting to find a toml configuration file with the database details
in one of the following locations:
- /etc/admiral/config.toml
- ./config.toml
- $HOME/.admiral.toml

Example configuration file:
[database]
user = "root"
password = "local"
host = "localhost:3306"
db = "ansible"

```
  -h, --help   help for admiral
