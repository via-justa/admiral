# Admiral

Admiral - a lightweight, opinionated, command line tool to manage [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) database based inventory. 

Managing hundreds or thousands of hosts on different infrastructure providers in a file based inventory can be a complicated task that require a lot on managemental overhead and can lead to misconfiguration, relationship loops between groups and very long inventory files.

Admiral is meant to solve this issue by storing the inventory in a database and allow for better visibility of the relationships, making the inventory searchable and making the management of the inventory easier and error prone.

As Prometheus is the most common monitoring tool this days and the one monitoring tool I favorite the most, I baked the option to export the inventory as [file_sd_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#file_sd_config) and provide the groups the host is part of as metric labels

Admiral main features:
- Creation and Edit of hosts and groups in JSON structure using your favorite editor
- Command line edit and delete of hosts, groups and their relationships
- Create new host / group from existing one (copy) to save time and need for configuration
- Full auto-completion of commands
- Realtime retrieval of hosts and groups for bash auto-completion
- Export of the inventory in ansible readable structure
- Export of the inventory in prometheus static file structure
- Ansible ping command wrapper to validate ansible can communicate with the hosts
- Setting default common configurations for new hosts / groups

Supported Operating systems
---------------------------

-   Windows 10
-   MacOs
-   Linux - Tested on Debian x64 based operating systems (Debian,
    Ubuntu, Mint...) but should work on any x64 Linux distribution

For other Operating Systems you can build from source

Database backend support
------------
- MariaDB > 13 (recommended)
- SQLite3

Installation
------------

-   Download and extract the relevant version from the [release page](https://github.com/via-justa/admiral/releases) to a location in your `$PATH`
-   Add configuration file is detailed in the `Configuration File` section
-   Add bash completion to your `.bashrc` or `.profile` (optional) 
    ```
    . <(admiral completion)
    ```

Configuration File
-----------

The tool is expecting to find a `toml` configuration file with the database details in one of the following locations:
- /etc/admiral/config.toml
- ./config.toml
- $HOME/.admiral.toml

Example configuration file:
```
[mariadb]
user = "root"
password = "local"
host = "localhost:3306"
db = "ansible"

[sqlite]
Path = "path/to/db.sqlite"

[defaults]
domain = "domain.local"
monitored = true
enabled = true
```

Usage
-----------
The tool comes with a full help menu that can be accessed with the flag `-h, --help`. 
The compleat command documentation is also available [here](/docs/admiral.md)

Configuring the Database
-----------
A compatible `MariaDB > 13` scheme can be found [here](/fixtures/mariadb/01_scheme.sql).
A compatible `sqlite3` scheme can be found [here](/fixtures/dqlite/01_scheme.sql).

Using the prometheus `file_sd_configs` and labels to filter jobs
-----------
The easiest way to get the `file_sd_configs` generated and read by prometheus is by using a cron job or systemd timer.
```
*/1 * * * * "/usr/local/bin/admiral prometheus > /etc/prometheus/prometheus_file_sd.json.new && mv /etc/prometheus/prometheus_file_sd.json.new /etc/prometheus/prometheus_file_sd.json"
```
This [nginx-exporter](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-prometheus-exporter) job example will keep all hosts with direct group matching regex `web-.*` and from those drop host with direct group `web-proxy` using the relabel_configs mechanism.
```
- job_name: 'nginx'
    file_sd_configs:
      - files:
        - "/etc/prometheus/prometheus_file_sd.json"
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ['group']
        regex: 'web-.*'
        action: keep
      - source_labels: ['group']
        regex: 'web-proxy'
        action: drop
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        regex:  '(.*)'
        target_label: __address__
        replacement: '${1}:9113'
```
